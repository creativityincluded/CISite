				<p><em>Whether you're a beginner just starting out</em> or a seasoned designer with a huge client list, making sure your skills are up-to-date can be a never-ending process. We think it's exciting to always be pushing yourself by learning new things and exploring new skills!</p>

				<h3 class="train">That's why we set you up for success</h3>
				<p><em>We believe the best way to learn something new</em> is to learn the basic foundation skills. That's why our training materials take a step-by-step, methodical approach that explains key terms and breaks complex concepts into ideas you'll actually understand.</p>

				<h3 class="train">Everything is created by designers, for designers</h3>
				<p><em>We know what it's like</em> to have a client project that you're trying to push to the next level. You try tutorial after tutorial after tutorial, but you still can't get them to work&mdash;you're more comfortable pushing pixels than writing PHP. We've been there&mdash;that's why we explain things in plain English.</p>
